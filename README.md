# Cofferer

Hello Neverwintians!
I wrote this script to help make life easier for those of us that count up guild coffer doantions.
It is intended to be used with a set of exported CSVs, exported from the game via the command:

```
/ExportGuildDonationLog <filename>
```

By default, all donatable currencies except for the tendable ones are included.
That means, out of the box you'll be getting statistics on log entries for:

- Heroic Shards of Power
- Adventurer's Shards of Power
- Dungeoneer's Shards of Power
- Conqueror's Shards of Power
- Professions Supplies
- Gold
- Glory
- Gems
- Surplus Equipment
- Astral Diamond Chests
- Treasures of Tyranny
- Frozen Treasures
- Fey Trinkets
- Dark Gifts
- Influence

## Configuration file
Here are the available configuration options:

- **LogLocation** - the directory containing the log files. All files in this directory will be parsed, so make sure that ONLY exported coffer log files in CSV format exist in this directory!
- **ResourceTypes** - the resource types that you want to have counted up

## Known issues with the coffer log (things I can't fix)
It looks like the last entries in the exported log are actually donations made to the decorator.
This may or may not be the intended behavior - it seemed odd to me.
Regardless, you can ignore these entries simply by not specifying them as one of the filtered resources in the configuration file.

Some entries also do not have a username associated with them.
These appear to be entries from before the update that inlcuded the export command.
It's expected that, over time, these log entires will be overwritten by newer ones, and therefore exported logs won't include any entries that don't have usernames.
Until then, you'll just have to deal with it the way it is :)
